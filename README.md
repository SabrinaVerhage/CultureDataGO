## About
Culture Data GO is a mini game made using [Processing](https://processing.org/) and can be played with a [Myo](https://www.myo.com/), a [LeapMotion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) or an ordinary keyboard.

Culture Data GO, inspired by [Open Cultuur Data Lab](http://www.opencultuurdata.nl/) and Pokemon GO, is a game in which you have to catch as much culture data as you can. Through gathering open culture data in a collaborative culture data art piece, Culture Data GO hopes to create awareness about the current accessibility of culture data. 
All data in Culture Data GO is purposely acquired from cultural institutions in The Netherlands with help from Open Cultuur Data Lab.

The audio was generated using [Noise Box 1](https://vimeo.com/191627376), an audiovisual sketch made using [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) in collaboration with [Saskia Freeke](https://github.com/sasj)
